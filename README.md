## Casting Should Be Free

Casting Should Be Free is a **free** and **open source** casting mod, no secrets, no paywall.

I myself am not a part of the competitive community but yesterday I joined some servers and looked around, everything I could see was toxicity and "oh use this casting mod, it only costs x dollars instead of y dollars".

It's awful that you have to pay to have access to the biggest part of comp, casting.

There are free casting mods that exist, but a big problem is they aren't ever open source. 

For example take `Terry's casting mod` to download you only need to join his discord and download a `.dll` file, also keep in mind that `.dll` files are able to execute arbitrary code on your computer plus they are usually obfuscated, which means it's harder to check for malware and security vulnerabilities.

AcuteBunny recently made a free casting mod too but that one is just a mess. It might be free but it still uses KeyAuth and you don't get the mod for free, you get a license to use the mod for free *(his own words)*.
